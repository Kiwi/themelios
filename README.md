# Themelios - NixOS on a rock-solid ZFS foundation.
Bootstrap a zfs-on-root NixOS configuration in one command.

## From any NixOS live disk, Themelios
- Automatically installs zfs and git to the livedisk if needed.
- Clones your git repo, optionally using a non-master branch.
- Finds your configuration.sh file automatically.
- Configures a zfs-on-root system to your configuration.sh file specification including the following options:
  * Uses sgdisk and/or wipefs, or dd to clear your disks.
  * Creates a single/mirror/raidz1/raidz2/raidz3 zpool.
  * Configures a zfs-on-root dataset scheme by default.
  * Optionally generates and imports an /etc/nixos/themelios-zfs.nix which includes sensible settings for zfs-on-root.
  * Optional "zfs-extra" enables further zfs-support options in NixOS.
  * Optional "overlay" feature allows easy custom pool creation settings and dataset scheme changes without need to hack on the script directly.
- Generates an /etc/nixos/configuration.nix which imports your top-level-nixfile from your repo-- (and thereby nixos-install's the rest of your operating system.)
- Aims to fail gracefully with continue and retry options.

## What Themelios does not do (yet)
- **UEFI** There is experimental uefi support in the testing branch. I'm not sure it's ready yet. Then again, it might work great, let me know. Thanks. Thu Sep 27 23:17:46 PDT 2018

- Full Disk encryption (Let's wait for zfsonlinux native encryption to reach full
maturity before implementing this...)

## Try it in it a VM right now!
- From a NixOS LiveDisk VM,
```bash
[root@nixos:~] bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-schaefers/themelios/master/themelios) vm-example a-schaefers/themelios
```
This command executes the script with curl and bash, which in turn downloads the a-schaefers/themelios repo from github, finds the "vm-example" directory with a configuration.sh file and begins the bootstrap process.

## "configuration.sh" [so-called]
Configuration.sh may actually be named anything you want and located anywhere in your project, Themelios will search for $1 by filename first and find it automatically, provided it is a uniquely named file.

If the filename isn't found, then Themelios will search for directories by the same name. So if you prefer using a standard naming convention, put a literal "configuration.sh" file inside of a uniquely named directory and feed Themelios the unique directory name.
The example "Try it init a VM right now!" command of this repository uses this method:
```bash
# vm-example is not a file inside this repo, but is a directory-- so this finds the dir hosts/vm-example/ and loads thel literal "configuration.sh" file.
[root@nixos:~] themelios vm-example a-schaefers/themelios
```

If none of this works for you, just tell themelios where the file is relative to project root:
```bash
[root@nixos:~] themelios ./hosts/vm-example/configuration.sh https://github.com/a-schaefers/themelios.git master
```

_NOTE: The username/repo-name shortcut only works for Github repos. Non-Github repos must provide the full remote._

**TL;DR. Feed Themelios a git repository url that contains a file which has the following configuration variables:**
```bash
# Themelios configuration.sh example

# DISK PREPARATION SETTINGS #

use_sgdisk_clear="true"    # use sgdisk --clear
use_wipefs_all="true"      # use wipefs --all
use_zero_disks="false"     # use dd if=/dev/zero ...

# ZFS POOL SETTINGS #

zfs_pool_name="zroot"
zfs_pool_type="mirror"     # use "" for single, or "mirror", "raidz1", etc.

# Note: using /dev/disk/by-id is also preferable.
zfs_pool_disks=("/dev/sda" "/dev/sdb")

# Datasets to be set with com.sun:auto-snapshot=true.
zfs_auto_snapshot=("$zfs_pool_name/HOME" "$zfs_pool_name/ROOT")

# If true, mount /nix outside of the / (root) dataset.
# Recommended true for now due to https://github.com/a-schaefers/themelios/issues/1
zfs_dataset_slashnix_no_root="true"

# Todo allow true or false for this exception.
zfs_use_atime="off"              # set to "on" or "off" (recommended "off" for ssd.)

zfs_make_swap="false"            # creates a swap zvol (Not recommended in zfs-land.)
zfs_swap_size="4G"

# If set, themelios will source them if the files exist alongside configuration.sh
zfs_pool_overlay_file=""         # override zpool_create()
zfs_dataset_overlay_file=""      # override datasets_create()

# NIX_OS BOOTSTRAP SETTINGS #

# Your top-level configuration.nix file to be bootstrapped-- (use the relative path from the project_root.)
# For example, to bootstrap project_root/hosts/vm-example/default.nix
nix_top_level_configuration="hosts/vm-example"

# Directory name of to clone your git-remote in "/" (root). Do not use slashes.
# This is intended to be the directory to operate the nix installation from.
# For example, here is mine! https://github.com/a-schaefers/nix-config
nix_repo_name="nix-config"

# Optionally inserted as "nixos-install --root /mnt $nix_install_opts"
nix_install_opts=""

# Creates /etc/nixos/zfs-configuration.nix with sensible settings.
nix_zfs_configuration_enabled="true"

# Enable "extra" options [below] in addition to zfs_configuration?
nix_zfs_configuration_extra_enabled="true"
```

## Optional overlays
If you want to override the default Themelios zpool_create() or datasets_create() functions with your own code, then set the optional variables in your configuration.sh,
```bash
# If set, themelios will source them if the files exist alongside configuration.sh
zfs_pool_overlay_file=""         # override zpool_create()
zfs_dataset_overlay_file=""      # override datasets_create()
```
Create the files and place them alongside wherever your configuration.sh is.
The [vm-example in this repo](https://github.com/a-schaefers/themelios/tree/master/hosts/vm-example)
uses stock pool and dataset overlays by default. :)

You can also set the postinstall_overlay_file in the same way,
```bash
postinstall_overlay_file=""      # run arbritrary code after nixos-install and before umount /mnt.
```
The following is an example using [postinstall_overlay_file that mounts a usb stick and copies my Private keys to my dotfiles](https://github.com/a-schaefers/nix-config/blob/master/hosts/adamant/postinstall.sh).

## zfs-configuration.nix
If **nix_zfs_configuration_enabled="true"** in a configuration.sh file, Themelios will create /etc/nixos/zfs-configuration.nix with the following zfs-on-root settings:
```bash
{ ... }:
{ imports = [];

# Configure grub with zfs support.
boot.supportedFilesystems = [ "zfs" ];
boot.loader.grub.enable = true;
boot.loader.grub.version = 2;
boot.loader.grub.devices = [
$(for disk_id in "${zfs_pool_disks[@]}"
do
echo "\"$disk_id\""
done)
];

# The 32-bit host id of the machine, formatted as 8 hexadecimal characters.
# You should try to make this id unique among your machines.
networking.hostId = "$zfs_host_id";

# noop, the recommended elevator with zfs.
# shell_on_fail allows to force import manually in the case of zfs import failure.
boot.kernelParams = [ "elevator=noop" "boot.shell_on_fail" ];

# Grub on zfs has been known to have a hard time finding kernels with really/long/dir/paths.
# Copy the kernels to /boot and avoid the issue.
boot.loader.grub.copyKernels = true;

# Ensure some safeguards are active that zfs uses to protect zfs pools.
boot.zfs.forceImportAll = false;
boot.zfs.forceImportRoot = false;
}

```

## Additional configuration.sh settings - zfs extra
Enable **nix_zfs_configuration_extra_enabled="true"** in addition to **nix_zfs_configuration_enabled="true"** in configuration.sh for the following extras:
```bash
# Enables periodic scrubbing of ZFS pools.
nix_zfs_extra_auto_scrub="true"

# Enable the (OpenSolaris-compatible) ZFS auto-snapshotting service.
nix_zfs_extra_auto_snapshot_enabled="true"
nix_zfs_extra_auto_snapshot_frequent="8"   # take a snapshot every 15 minutes and keep 8 in rotation
nix_zfs_extra_auto_snapshot_hourly="0"
nix_zfs_extra_auto_snapshot_daily="7"      # take a daily snapshot and keep 7 in rotation
nix_zfs_extra_auto_snapshot_weekly="0"
nix_zfs_extra_auto_snapshot_monthly="0"

# Use NixOs automatic garbage collection?
nix_zfs_extra_gc_automatic="true"
nix_zfs_extra_gc_dates="weekly"
nix_zfs_extra_gc_options="--delete-older-than 30d"

# Clean /tmp automatically on boot.
nix_zfs_extra_clean_tmp_dir="true"
```

## Last things
If you have special [post nixos-install] needs and do not want the script to automatically umount /mnt, export zpool, and ask to reboot, pass NOUMOUNT=1 to the script.
```bash
[root@nixos:~] NOUMOUNT=1 themelios foo bar ...
```

## Debugging
If something goes haywire and you just want to start the process all over without rebooting the machine, you could try the following:
```bash
[root@nixos:~] STARTOVER=1 POOL=zroot themelios foo bar
```

## Build Themelios into a custom NixOS rescue iso
Save the following somewhere on an already existing NixOS install as iso.nix:
```nix
{config, pkgs, ...}:
let
  themelios = pkgs.writeScriptBin "themelios" ''
    bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-schaefers/themelios/master/themelios) $@
  '';
in {
  imports = [
    <nixpkgs/nixos/modules/installer/cd-dvd/installation-cd-minimal.nix>
    <nixpkgs/nixos/modules/installer/cd-dvd/channel.nix>
  ];

  networking = {
    networkmanager.enable = true;
    wireless.enable = false; #networkmanager.enable handles this
  };
    boot.supportedFilesystems = [ "zfs" ];
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ git themelios ];
}
```

And build it!
```bash
nix-build '<nixpkgs/nixos>' -A config.system.build.isoImage -I nixos-config=iso.nix
```

The generated iso will be found inside the newly created "result/" directory.

_Note: It would be best practice to fork the project, audit the script, and modify the curl url to use your fork._ :)

## Putting it all together (a real-world example)
While I do not regard my personal setup to be the ideal for everybody, what follows is to show-case
[how Themelios can be used to bootstrap multiple, per-machine configurations](https://github.com/a-schaefers/nix-config).
The goal was simplicity, efficiency, and reproducibility.
